# Union-Find Mathematical Theory

**Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** is a data structure that tracks a collection of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations to:

1. **Find**: Determine which subset a particular element is in
2. **Union**: Join two subsets into a single subset

## Mathematical Model

- Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, ..., n\}$ be a set of $n$ elements
- A partition of $S$ is a collection of disjoint subsets $P = \{S_1, S_2, ..., S_k\}$ such that $\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} S_i = S$ and $S_i \cap S_j = \emptyset$ for $i \neq j$
- Each subset has a representative element (root)

## Key Mathematical Properties

1. **Equivalence Relation**: The "connected" relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
2. **Partition Property**: Union operations maintain the partition property
3. **Representative Uniqueness**: Each subset has exactly one representative

## Implementation: From Mathematical Model to Code

The mathematical model translates directly to our data structure design:

### Data Structure Implementation

```typescript
interface UnionFindNode {
  parent: number; // Parent pointer (self if root)
  rank: number; // Upper bound on tree height
}
```

This interface directly implements the mathematical concept where each element has a parent pointer and rank for optimization.

### Find Operation: Path Compression in Practice

```typescript
find(x: number): number {
  if (this.nodes[x].parent !== x) {
    // Path compression: make parent point directly to root
    this.nodes[x].parent = this.find(this.nodes[x].parent);
  }
  return this.nodes[x].parent;
}
```

**Mathematical Analysis**: The path compression optimization transforms the tree structure during traversal. Without compression, tree height can be $O(n)$ in the worst case. With compression, the amortized cost becomes $O(\alpha(n))$ where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function.

**Code-Math Connection**: The recursive call `this.find(this.nodes[x].parent)` implements the mathematical property that all nodes in a path should point directly to the root, reducing future traversal costs.

### Union Operation: Union by Rank Implementation

```typescript
union(x: number, y: number): boolean {
  const rootX = this.find(x);
  const rootY = this.find(y);

  if (rootX === rootY) return false; // Already connected

  // Union by rank: attach smaller tree to larger tree
  if (this.nodes[rootX].rank < this.nodes[rootY].rank) {
    this.nodes[rootX].parent = rootY;
  } else if (this.nodes[rootX].rank > this.nodes[rootY].rank) {
    this.nodes[rootY].parent = rootX;
  } else {
    this.nodes[rootY].parent = rootX;
    this.nodes[rootX].rank++; // Increase rank when trees are equal
  }

  return true;
}
```

The union by rank heuristic maintains the mathematical property that rank is an upper bound on tree height. This ensures logarithmic height bounds and optimal performance.

The conditional logic `if (this.nodes[rootX].rank < this.nodes[rootY].rank)` directly implements the mathematical principle of attaching smaller trees to larger ones, preserving the rank property and maintaining logarithmic height bounds.

## Algorithm Execution Example

The following demonstrates how the mathematical model translates to actual execution:

```typescript
// Initialize Union-Find with 5 elements
const uf = new UnionFind(5);
// Initial state: [0,1,2,3,4] - each element is its own root
// This creates 5 disjoint sets: {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}

// Union operations following the mathematical model
uf.union(0, 1); // Merge sets {0} and {1} → {0,1}
// State: [0,0,2,3,4] - element 1 now points to root 0
// The union operation finds the root of both elements and connects them

uf.union(1, 2); // Merge sets {0,1} and {2} → {0,1,2}
// State: [0,0,0,3,4] - element 2 now points to root 0
// Since 1 is already connected to 0, this connects 2 to the same root

// Find operations demonstrate path compression
console.log(uf.connected(0, 2)); // true - both elements have root 0
// The connected operation checks if two elements are in the same set
// by finding their roots and comparing them

console.log(uf.connected(0, 3)); // false - element 3 has root 3
// Elements 0 and 3 are in different sets, so they're not connected
```

**Code Explanation**:

1. **Initialization**: `new UnionFind(5)` creates 5 separate sets, each element being its own parent
2. **Union Operation**: `uf.union(0, 1)` merges two sets by making one root point to the other
3. **Path Compression**: When finding roots, the algorithm flattens the tree structure for future efficiency
4. **Connected Check**: `uf.connected(x, y)` determines if two elements are in the same set by comparing their roots

**Mathematical Verification**: The connectedness relation maintains the equivalence property - elements 0, 1, and 2 form an equivalence class with representative 0, while elements 3 and 4 remain in separate singleton sets.

## Time Complexity Analysis

**Amortized Performance**:

- **Find**: $O(\alpha(n))$ amortized where $\alpha(n) \leq 4$ for all practical inputs
- **Union**: $O(\alpha(n))$ amortized
- **Connected**: $O(\alpha(n))$ amortized

**Practical Impact**: Union-Find operations are effectively constant time in practice. The inverse Ackermann function $\alpha(n)$ grows so slowly that for any realistic dataset size, it's essentially constant.

## Code Implementation Details

**Complete Union-Find Class**:

```typescript
export class UnionFind {
  private nodes: UnionFindNode[];
  private stats = {
    compressionCount: 0,
    unionCount: 0,
  };

  constructor(size: number) {
    // Initialize each element as its own parent with rank 0
    this.nodes = Array.from({ length: size }, (_, i) => ({
      parent: i,
      rank: 0,
    }));
  }

  find(x: number): number {
    if (this.nodes[x].parent !== x) {
      // Path compression: make parent point directly to root
      this.nodes[x].parent = this.find(this.nodes[x].parent);
      this.stats.compressionCount++;
    }
    return this.nodes[x].parent;
  }

  union(x: number, y: number): boolean {
    const rootX = this.find(x);
    const rootY = this.find(y);

    if (rootX === rootY) return false;

    this.stats.unionCount++;

    // Union by rank optimization
    if (this.nodes[rootX].rank < this.nodes[rootY].rank) {
      this.nodes[rootX].parent = rootY;
    } else if (this.nodes[rootX].rank > this.nodes[rootY].rank) {
      this.nodes[rootY].parent = rootX;
    } else {
      this.nodes[rootY].parent = rootX;
      this.nodes[rootX].rank++;
    }

    return true;
  }

  connected(x: number, y: number): boolean {
    return this.find(x) === this.find(y);
  }
}
```
